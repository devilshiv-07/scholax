USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Copy each prompt separately into your AI image generator
2. Generate multiple variations and pick the best
3. Save images with descriptive names:
   - hero-illustration.png
   - workflow-process.png
   - dashboard-showcase.png
4. Place in /public folder
5. Update image placeholders in app/page.tsx with actual images

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Midjourney (Best for illustrations)
- DALL-E 3 (Good for detailed UI mockups)
- Leonardo.ai (Good for consistent style)
- Adobe Firefly (Commercial use friendly)
- Ideogram (Good for text in images)

For best results, you may need to iterate on prompts and add style references like:
"in the style of [specific designer/product]" or use --style parameters in Midjourney.
